Rules of the game
-
The computer guesses a word (a random word selected from a file). The player enters a letter that can be included in this word. If such a letter is in a word, the computer displays it as many times as it appears in the word. If there is no such letter, the computer counts the error and a circle in the loop representing the head is added to the gallows. The player then continues to guess the letters until he guesses the whole word. For each wrong answer, the computer adds one part of the torso to the gallows (head, neck, torso, 2 arms and 2 legs).
If the torso in the gallows is drawn completely, then the player loses and is considered hanged. If the player manages to guess the word, he wins. 7 mistakes are allowed.

Instructions how to add words
-
In order to change or add the words that the computer thinks, you need to edit the `words.txt` file, which is located in the `hangman/data` folder.
###Attention!
Each word is written on a **new line**. All letters of the word are written in UPPERCASE.
